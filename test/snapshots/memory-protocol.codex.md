# Mind Memory Protocol (Codex)

Use this protocol when Codex is connected to the `mind` MCP server.

## Required First Actions

1. `checkpoint_query` — find available checkpoints for the current project space
2. `checkpoint_load { checkpointName: "<name>" }` — recover a specific checkpoint by name
3. `space_get` — check if the project space exists (use repo/directory name: `projects/<repo-name>`)
4. If space doesn't exist: `space_create` with `tags: ["type:project"]`
5. `memory_query { space: "<project>", search: "<current-task-keywords>" }` — find related context

Call `system_instructions` before using memory tools in a new session for full usage details.

## Memory Types

- Checkpoint = live/ephemeral work state. Keep goal, pending work, and current
  blockers here; update it after subtasks and before risky changes.
- Session summary = chronological log/recovery record created from a completed
  checkpoint. It preserves what happened, but it is evidence, not canonical
  truth.
- Durable/canonical memory = atomic actionable knowledge for future sessions.
- Living reference memory = maintained current truth map for a project, domain,
  architecture, style, or workflow.

## During Work

### Durable memory threshold

Create or update durable memories when the information is likely useful in
future sessions: stable decisions, verified root causes, final fixes, reusable
patterns, user preferences, or significant config/domain facts. Keep transient
observations, routine progress, and routine validation results with no new findings
in checkpoints or session summaries.

Durable memories are separate from session summaries. Use durable memories when
future sessions need stable decisions, root causes, patterns, preferences,
config, or domain facts.

Use `memory_add` for new durable knowledge:

```
memory_add {
  space: "projects/<repo-name>",
  name: "<descriptive-kebab-name>",
  content: "**What**: ...\n**Why**: ...\n**Where**: ...\n**Learned**: ...",
  tags: ["cat:decision"],
  links_to: ["<space:name of related memory>"]
}
```

- Every memory MUST have at least 1 tag: `cat:decision`, `cat:bugfix`, `cat:discovery`, `cat:pattern`, `cat:preference`, `cat:config`
- Always check for related memories with `memory_query { space: "<project>", search: "<keywords>" }` and pass their names to `links_to`
- When a new memory depends on, updates, or explains another memory, pass related memories in `links_to`.
- After adding with `links_to`, check `links_created` and `links_failed`; retry important failed links with `link_create`.
- Update checkpoint after completing subtasks: `checkpoint_save`

Persist verified root causes, regressions, risk decisions, or durable validation
patterns. Don't persist routine validation outcomes unless they change future
work.

### Before creating a durable memory

Confirm it meets this threshold:

- **Future utility**: Will a future session need this?
- **Novelty**: Is this new knowledge (not already captured)?
- **Evidence**: Is it verified (not speculation)?
- **Stability**: Is it settled (not likely to change soon)?

If any answer is NO, keep it in the checkpoint or session summary instead.

### Status tags

`status:*` tags are convention-only, not schema-enforced. Use well-normed tags
such as `status:proposed`, `status:validated`, `status:failed`,
`status:superseded`, `status:obsolete`, `status:final`, and `status:living`.

### Living reference memories

Use living references for compact current truth. Create them at T2 by default;
let reads naturally promote them to T1. Pin only 1–3 critical references when
explicitly warranted or approved.

Tags are authoritative. Required tags: `type:reference`, exactly one `ref:*`, and `status:living`.
Recommended refs: `ref:project-map`, `ref:architecture`, `ref:style`,
`ref:domain`, `ref:workflow`. The `ref:*` tag defines the reference category; the memory name is the readable identifier.

Recommended names: `architecture-overview`, `project-map`, `style-guide`, `domain-model`, and `workflow-notes`.

Recommended sections: Purpose, Current truth, Key areas/files/concepts, Active
conventions, Source memories, Last reviewed, Maintenance notes.

When current truth changes, use `memory_update` on the living reference and
link it to source memories. Sessions remain evidence/logs, not canonical truth.

### Cautious deletion

Use `memory_delete` only when a memory is clearly obsolete, no longer
applicable, and has no historical value. Otherwise, mark it with
`status:obsolete` or `status:superseded` and link the replacement.

## Session End

1. Checkpoints hold live state; `checkpoint_done` completes the active checkpoint and creates a same-space `session-*` summary memory in `projects/<repo-name>` with `type:session` + `cat:summary` at T3.
2. (optional) `memory_update` to enrich the session memory if needed

## Checkpoint Aging

If the active checkpoint is **less than 30 minutes old**: continue using it.
If it is **30 minutes or older**: close it with `checkpoint_done` and create a new one with `checkpoint_save`.

## Post-Compaction Recovery

If context resets or compaction happens:

1. `checkpoint_query` to find available checkpoints
2. `checkpoint_load { checkpointName: "<name>" }` to restore a specific checkpoint
3. `memory_query { space: "<project>", search: "<keywords>" }` for recent context
4. Re-establish goal, pending steps, and relevant files before making edits

## Quick Checklist

- Start with `checkpoint_query`, `checkpoint_load`, `space_get`, and task-focused `memory_query`
- Save live progress with `checkpoint_save`
- Add tagged durable memories for stable knowledge that future sessions need
- Link related memories with `links_to` or `link_create`
- Close active work with `checkpoint_done`
